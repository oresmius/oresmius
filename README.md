Greetings!

I'm FÃ¡bio, I have a degree in accounting and I'm currently graduating in data science. I love statistics, philosophy, music, programming in Python, R, Power BI and taking care of cats. I'm a radio amateur (PY6FX / PY1XR), and I'm developing a micro looger for contests in portable operations.
